Active Contouring - Snake model

 - Use snake_simple.m to run the snake

 - snake_brain.m uses a dicom image but to use the snake in DICOM images the
   algorithm needs further optimisation (e.g. to not get stuck on edges which are
   not of interest)

./pdfs
 - contains presentation and main literature

./data
 - contains dicom image for snake_brain.m and simpleObjects image
